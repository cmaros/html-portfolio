<h1>Carol's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Of the Brazilian Variety</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Central do Brasil</h3>
<p>This is a simple movie to understand.</p>
<h3>Vermelho do Brasil</h3>
<p>I don't know what this movie is about.</p>

<p>This is a violent movie, but it is great to learn a little about life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.</p>
